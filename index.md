I started my career in the visual arts, which ultimately lead to a masters degree in public administration (nonprofit management). While I loved these roles, and the arts and nonprofit sector are still very important to me, what I discovered about myself is I really excelled when it came down to the more technical and analytical aspects. I enjoy conducting research and using data to solve problems.

I took a big risk when I decided to make a bit of a career change and attended the **[Carolina Code School](https://carolinacodeschool.org/)** to become a software developer.

Since completing the program, I've been a Ruby on Rails developer at a small startup in Greenville, SC.

I'm currently open new opportunities. I love working in RoR, but would be excited to learn new languages or frameworks in the right role.

Outside of programming, I enjoy walking my dog, hiking, traveling with my husband, and painting.
