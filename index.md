I started my career in the visual arts, which ultimately lead to a masters degree in nonprofit management. While I loved these roles (and the arts are still so close to my heart), what I discovered about myself through my schooling and nonprofit jobs is I really excelled when it came down to the more technical and analytical aspects. I enjoy conducting research and using data to solve problems.

I took a big risk in 2018 when I decided to make a bit of a career change and attended the [Carolina Code School](https://carolinacodeschool.org/) to become a software developer.

Since completing that program a year ago, Iâ€™ve been working with an amazing and supportive engineering team at Division of Labor.
